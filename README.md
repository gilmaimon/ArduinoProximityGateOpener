# ArduinoProximityGateOpener
Arduino based garage opener for my home garage door.
The project consists of 2 parts: 
- A transimtter (Beacon) - a device placed in the car and transmits a signal in fixed intervals.
- A receiver - The reciever controls the garage door and opens/closes it depending on the time that have passed since last received transmission.
- 
This project uses my library [`ArduinoComponents`](https://github.com/gilmaimon/ArduinoComponents)
